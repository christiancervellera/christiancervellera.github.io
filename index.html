        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p> I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. <br>
      I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/valentino-larcinese">Valentino Larcinese</a> and <a href= "https://stephanewolton.com/">Stephane Wolton</a> in the Political Economy (<a href="https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/events/Political-Science-and-Political-Economy/">PSPE</a>) research group. <br> I am also affiliated to the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI">Data Science Institute</a>.<br><br>

      My research interests orbit around <strong>Historical Political Economy</strong>, using quasi-experimental designs and data science tool kits. I am particularly interested in the political economy of inequality and the role of labor unions therein.  <br><br>

      Prior to LSE, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair">FAIR, Norwegian School of Economics</a> in Bergen. <br>

      I hold a BA (2021) and MSc (2023) in Economics from the <a href="https://dse.unibo.it/it/index.html"> Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna</a>. <br>

            <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
			Focusing on the descriptive representation of the working class in the UK, the first paper investigates the political consequences of trade union decline on the descriptive representation of the working class in the United Kingdom. Drawing on historical reforms initiated by the 1980 Employment Act — a pivotal moment that imposed stringent requirements on Closed Shop Agreements — I leverage a novel shift-share instrumental variable strategy exploiting variation in industry- and constituency-level exposure to union weakening. Preliminary findings show how the weakening of trade unions induced by this policy shock translates into a marked reduction in the electoral presence and success of working-class candidates. Beyond the economic consequences traditionally associated with de-unionization, my findings highlight the pivotal role of unions as political intermediaries who enable working-class political recruitment, candidacy sponsorship, and campaign mobilization. 
				The potential results offer new insights into the broad mechanisms driving underrepresentation and highlight key institutional factors that can mitigate class-based disparities in democratic systems.

             This paper investigates the long-term effects of the Red Scare on social capital in Italy. Revolutionary threats required important political mobilization, introducing social struggle to previously inactive areas in the country. 

    		Drawing on war casualties as a source of exogenous variation, I show that the Red Scare (1919-20) led to a sizeable decrease in social capital within the length of a generation, with limited evidence of long-term effects. The impact varies and is positive for communities historically mobilizing for the first time during the period, as documented by historical accounts. 

    		I suggest evidence in favour of the role of polarization and the subsequent political violence. <!-- long abstract content -->
