        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p> I am a MRes/PhD student in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. <br>
      I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/valentino-larcinese">Valentino Larcinese</a> and <a href= "https://stephanewolton.com/">Stephane Wolton</a> in the Political Economy (<a href="https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/events/Political-Science-and-Political-Economy/">PSPE</a>) research group. <br><br>

      My research interests center around <strong>Historical Political Economy</strong>, using causal inference and data science tools.  <br><br>

      Prior to LSE, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair">FAIR, Norwegian School of Economics</a> in Bergen. <br>

      I hold a BA (2021) and MSc (2023) in Economics from the <a href="https://dse.unibo.it/it/index.html"> Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna</a>. <br>

<li> The Bolshevik roots of social capital: an empirical investigation	      
<br>   <details> 
<summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper investigates the long-term effects of the Red Scare on social capital in Italy. Revolutionary threats required important political mobilization, introducing social struggle to previously inactive areas in the country. 
    Drawing on war casualties as a source of exogenous variation, I show that the Red Scare (1919-20) led to a sizeable decrease in social capital within the length of a generation, with limited evidence of long-term effects. The impact varies and is positive for communities historically mobilizing for the first time during the period, as documented by historical accounts. 
    I suggest evidence in favour of the role of polarization and the subsequent political violence.
