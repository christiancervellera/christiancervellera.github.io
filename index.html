        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>

        <p> I am a MRes/PhD student at the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. <br>
      I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/valentino-larcinese">Valentino Larcinese</a> in the Political Economy (<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/research/research-groups/political-science-and-political-economy">PSPE</a>) research group. <br>

      My research interests center around historical political economy, using causal inference and data science tools.  <br>

      Prior to LSE, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair">FAIR, Norwegian School of Economics</a> in Bergen. <br>

      I hold a B.A. (2021) and M.Sc. (2023) in Economics from the <a href="https://dse.unibo.it/it/index.html"> Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna</a>. <br>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
